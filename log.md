# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked through the Basic HTML and HTML5 module on freecodecamp.org

**Thoughts:** It was nice to get a refresher on some of the basics that I haven't looked at in a little while. I'm excited to move on to the CSS section, where I can definitely 
improve on my front end and design skills.

### Day 2: July 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked through the first half of the Basic CSS module on freecodecamp.org

**Thoughts:** I'm excited to dive into CSS and get a better understanding of what it can do. As I feel CSS is my weakest skill currently, getting a solid rooting in the basics will be a great jumping off point to grow my skills in that area.
